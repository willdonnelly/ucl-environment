UCL ENVIRONMENT
===============

Uses UCL-FFI to bind to the 'getenv', 'setenv', and 'unsetenv' functions
exported by libc. Provides these abilities even on schemes which only
provide one or two of them natively. Raises an exception when an error
is signalled by the underlying functions.

GETENV key
  Return the string associated with the environment variable KEY. Returns #f
  if the key doesn't exist.

SETENV key val overwrite?
  Set environment variable KEY to the string VAL. If OVERWRITE? is true, sets
  it even if it is already set. Otherwise, only sets it if KEY is currently
  unset.

UNSETENV key
  Remove environment variable KEY from the environment.
